      <h1>Introduction></h1>
         <P>The obesity epedeminc observed in the UK and other Wester nations over the past two decaddes "increased the focus on eathing habits of the nation" (James 2008 .p. 120).  
           In an attempt to promote better health of the population and reduce the burden of obesity and related health conditions on the NHS, 
           the recent government white paper Healthy lives, Healthy people (HM Government 2010.p.19) has identifed improvemnents in diet and lifestyle as a public priority. </p> </Section>

          <p> it is widely accepted that students leaving home to attend university are likely to experience a significant shift in their lifestyle, including their diet
          and this is supported by research and evidence from the UK and other European contries (papadaki et al., 2007.p.169).  this may encompass increased alchol intake,
          reduced intake of fruit and vegatables, and an increaxsed intake of fatty foods," as well as impaction on overall eating patterns" 
          (arnot 2010, online: Dodd et al.,210p. 73: Spanos & Hankey, 2010.p, 102). </p>

         <P> Some studies hbave suggested that there may be different patters of unhealthy eating amongst male and felmale 
           groups of students. For example research conducted by Dr nRicard Costa and Dr Farzad Amirbdollahian at coventry university  found that males may be at risk
           of what they term "disorder eating patterns".  in addition, the study also suggests that males are at greater risk of not eating five portions of fruit and
           vegatables per day. this research is based on a substantial sample size, using data derived for in-depth interviews with approxomatly 130 under graduates although 
           there are plans to increase this to include nearly 400 participants.  It is acknowledged by the researchers that this may represent those only events occuring at one 
           university, although there are also plans to expand the study sample across another 2 universities in the future. (Arnot. 2010. online) <p/>
